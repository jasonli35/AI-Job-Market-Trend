"Jr. ML Engineer","Pasadena, CA","2024-01-18","BallerTV","BallerTV is a venture-backed startup building the world's largest sports network from the ground up. To date, our AI and computer vision video technology have enabled us to be the world's most prolific producer of live youth sports streams. We film games using a custom ultra-wide fisheye lens to capture an entire basketball court, soccer field, or volleyball court at once. Then we use machine learning to detect the playing area, the people, the balls, and anything else we need to completely understand the scene. We combine all of that information to create a trajectory for our virtual camera to follow the action similarly to how a videographer would film. Rather than relying on a physical actuator, we virtually move the camera by re-projecting the fisheye view. We then live stream the video anywhere in the world. And we do all of this in real time on an iPhone.

This is a junior-level role focusing on machine-learning projects related to sports and video processing. Strong skills in math, good spatio-temporal logic, experience with video preferred. Focus on optimizations is a plus. Strong coding and architecture skills desired.

Given the significant amount of creativity and brainstorming needed to build groundbreaking technology, this is an in-office role. Applicants must be available to work full-time on-site at our Pasadena headquarters.

Projects to include:


 * Analyzing images to find playing surfaces and automatically bound and map them
 * Analyzing video and images to detect players and the ball in a variety of sports using ML models developed in-house
 * Analyzing video to detect events in a variety of sports
 * Developing camera motion policies based on players, balls, and events
 * Most models will run on iOS devices in real time, fully utilizing the CPU, GPU (Metal), and Apple Neural Engine (ANE), so optimizing for time is always important
 * Working on CUDA GPUs
 * Developing visualizations and introspection tools
 * Working with an existing code base across Python, C++, and ML/DL libraries and also developing new code and architecture
 * Working in a small team on substantial projects, with strict deadlines
 * Contribute to design discussions
   
   
   

Skills to include:


 * Strong Python knowledge
 * PyTorch
 * Git experience
 * C++, basic knowledge necessary, but stronger skills highly desired
 * Desire and willingness to learn and understand the projects
 * Strong math and problem-solving skills
 * Ability to reason about projects that depend on both space and time

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

About The Role

We are looking for an ML Engineer to join our small but nimble AI team whose mission is to make Notion an ML-powered product. As an ML Engineer, you will work on incorporating large language models (LLMs), embeddings, and other AI technologies into Notion’s product in a high quality way. You’ll be exploring the boundaries of what’s possible with ML technology and finding innovative ways to apply new industry learnings to Notion’s offering.

What You'll Achieve


 * Work with the team to prototype and experiment with AI model quality improvements, either by fine tuning, prompt engineering, or building new models when needed
 * Productionize and launch new AI technology integrations into Notion’s core product
 * Collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver product features on time
 * Stay up-to-date with the latest AI technologies and trends
   
   
   

Skills You'll Need To Bring


 * Domain Expert, Teacher and Learner: You have experience building AI products using LLMs, embeddings or other ML natural language technologies. 3+ years of experience in one or more of the following areas: machine learning, recommendation or ranking systems, natural language understanding/generation or artificial intelligence. You’re excited about bringing your pre-existing knowledge to the team, but you balance that with perpetual curiosity and understanding that there is always more to learn.
 * Holistic Problem Solver: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building.
 * Communicate with Care: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth and the growth, learning, and development of your teammates.
 * Impact Driven: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad. Work isn't a solo endeavor for you, and you enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals.
   
   
   

Nice To Haves


 * You understand how parts of a system fit together, from the user interface to the data model. You are familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL, and have experience building products from ground up.
 * You’re proficient with data pipeline technologies: Spark, DBT, etc
 * You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
 * You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and can balance business priorities with individuals’ strengths, areas of interest, and career development goals.
 * You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
 * You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or literature.
   
   
   

We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).

What You'll Do:

Build and own machine learning pipelines end-to-end! For us, this means:

 * Maintain an obsessive focus on delivering value to our customers.
 * Maintain ownership of ML pipelines, all the way to surfacing the features to customers, and measuring their impact.
 * Partner closely with the entire R&D organization, working in a highly collaborative environment where you’ll be exposed to the entire scope of a deliverable rather than just the ML portion of the project.
 * Quickly prototype and iterate on new algorithmic concepts, and prioritize them based on customer needs.
 * Develop and deploy large-scale ML systems using the relevant state-of-the-art AI approaches to solve the problem.
 * Guide efforts to acquire high-quality datasets.
 * Manage and improve the ML pipeline, from data management, model management, and resource scheduling.




What You'll Need to Be Successful:

 * Proven experience delivering ML features from research to production with a preference for candidates with an exposure to application development.
 * At least 3 years of delivering production systems in Python, Java or Scala.
 * Start-up or equivalent experience where you demonstrate strong attention to detail and ownership balanced with a scrappy, get-stuff-done, mentality.
 * 3+ years of machine learning research and development experience; professional use of deep learning or computer vision is a bonus!
 * You have a computer science or related background with solid fundamentals in algorithms and the math behind them.
 * Feel at home communicating research and other complex ideas to a broad swath of the company including engineers and non-engineers.




We’re a growing team that works collaboratively, is supportive of each other, and is highly energized by the opportunity for a large impact. We actively work to promote an inclusive environment, valuing passion and the ability to learn. You’re encouraged to apply even if your experience doesn’t precisely match the job description!

Our Story

Our founders, Spence and John met at Google working on Google Translate. As researchers at Stanford and Berkeley, they both worked on language technology to make information accessible to everyone. They were amazed to learn that Google Translate wasn’t used for enterprise products and services inside the company and left to start a new company to address this need – Lilt.

At its core, Lilt has always been a machine learning company since its incorporation on March 6, 2015. At the time, machine translation didn’t meet the quality standard for enterprise translations, so Lilt assembled a cutting-edge research team tasked with closing that gap. While meeting customer demand for translation services, Lilt has prioritized investments in Large Language Models, believing that this foundation was imperative to the future of enterprise translation.

Our Story

Our founders, Spence and John met at Google working on Google Translate. As researchers at Stanford and Berkeley, they both worked on language technology to make information accessible to everyone. They were amazed to learn that Google Translate wasn’t used for enterprise products and services inside the company and left to start a new company to address this need – Lilt.

At its core, Lilt has always been a machine learning company since its incorporation on March 6, 2015. At the time, machine translation didn’t meet the quality standard for enterprise translations, so Lilt assembled a cutting-edge research team tasked with closing that gap. While meeting customer demand for translation services, Lilt has prioritized investments in Large Language Models, believing that this foundation was imperative to the future of enterprise translation.

Intelligent machines powered by AI computers that can learn, reason, and interact with people are no longer science fiction. Image recognition and speech recognition — GPU deep learning has provided the foundation for machines to learn, perceive, reason, and solve problems. The GPU started out as the engine for simulating human imagination, conjuring up the amazing virtual worlds of video games and Hollywood films. Now, Nvidia’s GPU runs deep learning algorithms, simulating human intelligence, and acts as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Just as human imagination and intelligence are linked, computer graphics and artificial intelligence come together in our architecture. Two modes of the human brain, two modes of the GPU. This may explain why Nvidia GPUs are used broadly for deep learning, and Nvidia is known as “the AI computing company.”

Our Story

Our founders, Spence and John met at Google working on Google Translate. As researchers at Stanford and Berkeley, they both worked on language technology to make information accessible to everyone. They were amazed to learn that Google Translate wasn’t used for enterprise products and services inside the company and left to start a new company to address this need – Lilt.

At its core, Lilt has always been a machine learning company since its incorporation on March 6, 2015. At the time, machine translation didn’t meet the quality standard for enterprise translations, so Lilt assembled a cutting-edge research team tasked with closing that gap. While meeting customer demand for translation services, Lilt has prioritized investments in Large Language Models, believing that this foundation was imperative to the future of enterprise translation.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Stripe’s mission is to build the economic infrastructure for the internet. Risk Engineering brings together machine learning with product development to lower Stripe’s financial and regulatory risk at scale, while retaining a best in class user experience. We build ML and backend systems to catch fraudsters, understand users’ cash flow and financial health, and ensure Stripe’s users are compliant with regulatory and financial partner requirements. We protect Stripe’s brand while also protecting the company from financial losses that can put Stripe’s business at risk.

The Risk group consists of machine learning, backend, and full stack engineers who tackle this problem through creative new product ideas and impactful machine learning models. We are undertaking several new efforts, where you can have an outsized impact on the architecture, implementation, and design choices behind these systems.

What you’ll do

Responsibilities


 * Designing, training, improving & launching models
 * Proposing and implementing ideas that directly reduce Stripe’s financial losses
 * Building systems that evaluate businesses for risk and take appropriate actions
 * Working with our partner teams to launch new policies that directly impact Stripe’s bottom line
 * Helping engineers across the company to develop technologies for scaling our infrastructure
 * Debugging production issues across services and multiple levels of the stack
   
   
   

Who you are

We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.

Minimum Requirements


 * Have at least 2 years of industry experience in training ML models
 * Enjoy and have experience shipping ML models in a large-scale production environment
 * Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems
 * Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to business impact
 * Thrive in a collaborative environment
   
   
   

Preferred Qualifications


 * Have experience in Python, Scala (Spark), or Ruby
   
   
   

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.

We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority.

We’re a dedicated scientific community, committed to “solving intelligence” and ensuring our technology is used for widespread public benefit.

We’ve built a supportive and inclusive environment where collaboration is encouraged and learning is shared freely. We don’t set limits based on what others think is possible or impossible. We drive ourselves and inspire each other to push boundaries and achieve ambitious goals.

The role

To succeed in this role you will need to be passionate about advancing science using machine learning and other computational techniques. You'll join an interdisciplinary team of domain experts, ML researchers and engineers exploring a diverse set of important scientific problems in biology, physics, mathematics and other areas. Our work is organised into several longer-term focus areas which aim to achieve step changes to the state-of-the-art (as exemplified in e.g. AlphaFold, AlphaMissense and FunSearch). You'll leverage our unique mix of expertise, data and computational resources to experiment and iterate both rapidly and at scale.

As an embedded Research Engineer you will collaborate with researchers and software engineers to develop and run experiments exploring new applications of AI to science problems. The team is pioneering in many different domains so you may take part in exploratory work validating early ideas or work in a maturing area to deepen and exploit a promising line of research. You may also contribute to the scientific knowledge and experience of the team with your own scientific domain knowledge. You will work with internal and external researchers on pioneering research bridging AI and science.

Key responsibilities:


 * Plan and perform rapid prototyping of machine learning techniques applied to problems in science
 * Undertake exploratory analysis to inform experimentation and research directions
 * Make improvements to model architectures and training procedures of machine learning models

 * Collaborate with internal and external scientific domain experts
   
   

The role will suit candidates who enjoy working in a heavily experimental setting with large and noisy datasets and who wish to immerse themselves in innovative science, ML and AI research.

About You

In order to set you up for success as a Research Engineer at Google DeepMind, we look for the following skills and experience:


 * Masters degree in computer science, electrical engineering, science, mathematics or equivalent experience
 * Applied experience with machine learning, preferably modern deep learning techniques (e.g. Transformers, Diffusion, LLMs)
 * Experience with at least one programming language (with a preference for those commonly used in machine learning or scientific computing such as Python or C++)
 * Knowledge of linear algebra, calculus and statistics equivalent to at least first-year university coursework
 * Experience exploring, analysing and visualising data
 * Experience using Jax, PyTorch, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas or similar ML/scientific libraries
   
   

In addition, the following would be an advantage:


 * Experience optimising large-scale training and fine-tuning large models
 * Experience working with large and noisy datasets
 * Experience collaborating across fields
 * Scientific knowledge (particularly biology, chemistry and physics)
   
   

When assessing technical background we will take a holistic view of the mix of scientific, ML and computational experience. We do not expect you to be an expert in all fields simultaneously. However, except for scientific knowledge, since the role serves as a bridge between all three, some experience in each is necessary.

What We Offer

At Google DeepMind, we want employees and their families to live happier and healthier lives, both in and out of work, and our benefits reflect that. Some select benefits we offer: enhanced maternity, paternity, adoption, and shared parental leave, private medical and dental insurance for yourself and any dependents, and flexible working options.

Our Story

Our founders, Spence and John met at Google working on Google Translate. As researchers at Stanford and Berkeley, they both worked on language technology to make information accessible to everyone. They were amazed to learn that Google Translate wasn’t used for enterprise products and services inside the company and left to start a new company to address this need – Lilt.

At its core, Lilt has always been a machine learning company since its incorporation on March 6, 2015. At the time, machine translation didn’t meet the quality standard for enterprise translations, so Lilt assembled a cutting-edge research team tasked with closing that gap. While meeting customer demand for translation services, Lilt has prioritized investments in Large Language Models, believing that this foundation was imperative to the future of enterprise translation.

Fieldguide is establishing a new state of trust for global commerce and capital markets through automating and streamlining the work of assurance and audit practitioners specifically within cybersecurity, privacy, and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance). Put simply, we build software for the people who enable trust between businesses.

We’re based in San Francisco, CA, but built as a remote-first company that enables you to do your best work from anywhere. We're backed by top investors including Bessemer Venture Partners, 8VC, Floodgate, Y Combinator, DNX Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Justin Kan, Elad Gil, and more.

We value diversity — in backgrounds and in experiences. We need people from all backgrounds and walks of life to help build the future of audit and advisory. Fieldguide’s team is inclusive, driven, humble and supportive. We are deliberate and self-reflective about the kind of team and culture that we are building, seeking teammates that are not only strong in their own aptitudes but care deeply about supporting each other's growth.

As an early stage start-up employee, you’ll have the opportunity to build out the future of business trust. We make audit practitioners’ lives easier by eliminating up to 50% of their work and giving them better work-life balance.

You're obsessed with data: We have a rich dataset that is ripe for automation and AI. With our data advantage, we can provide our users with intelligent automation, predictions of common workflow patterns, and analytics that will fundamentally change the structure of audits.

You greatly value culture: Our goals are lofty, we work very hard, and we want to transform an industry. More importantly, we also work responsibly. We place a premium on building a sustainable, inclusive, high EQ, high feedback, and safe company that celebrates individuals of all backgrounds.

‍Responsibilities:


 * Be an essential technical contributor at a seed-stage company as it scales.

"ML Applications Engineer","Seattle, WA","2024-04-25","Phaidra","About Phaidra

Phaidra is building the future of industrial automation.

The world today is filled with static, monolithic infrastructure. Factories, power plants, buildings, etc. operate the same they've operated for decades — because the controls programming is hard-coded. Thousands of lines of rules and heuristics that define how the machines interact with each other. The result of all this hard-coding is that facilities are frozen in time, unable to adapt to their environment while their performance slowly degrades.

Phaidra creates AI-powered control systems for the industrial sector, enabling industrial facilities to automatically learn and improve over time. Specifically:


 * We use reinforcement learning algorithms to provide this intelligence, converting raw sensor data into high-value actions and decisions.
 * We focus on industrial applications, which tend to be well-sensorized with measurable KPIs — perfect for reinforcement learning.
 * We enable domain experts (our users) to configure the AI control systems (i.e. agents) without writing code. They define what they want their AI agents to do, and we do it for them.
   
   

Our team has a track record of applying AI to some of the toughest problems. From achieving superhuman performance with DeepMind's AlphaGo, to reducing the energy required to cool Google's Data Centers by 40%, we deeply understand AI and how to apply it in production for massive impact.

Phaidra is based in the USA but 100% remote; we do not have a physical office. We hire employees internationally with the help of our partner, OysterHR. Our team is currently located throughout the USA, Canada, UK, Norway, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and India.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $192,000 - $288,000. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

About Stripe

Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.

About The Team

Our Applied ML team aims to reform how our users interact with Stripe. We are doing so by (a) automating the easy tasks, and (b) assisting our users in the difficult tasks. Some examples include helping our users resolve issues with Stripe faster or making it easier for our users to sign up and navigate Stripe. We are using the latest LLMs as well as fine-tuning our own models. We're an end-to-end team going from ideas to models to shipping in production. You can learn more about our team’s work from this recent talk.

What you’ll do

As a machine learning engineer, you will be responsible for analyzing opportunities, proposing ideas, training & evaluating ML models, running experiments, and deploying everything to production. You will also have the opportunity to contribute to and influence ML architecture at Stripe as well as be a part of a larger ML community.

Responsibilities

Our team operates fluidly and here are some problems you may tackle:


 * How do we evaluate a system offline & online?
 * How do we improve performance to match (and beat) humans?
 * How do we ensure model quality doesn’t degrade online?
 * Does fine-tuning an LLM give us better performance?
 * What are the right OSS and in-house platforms we should invest in?
   
   
   

Who you are

We are looking for ML Engineers who are passionate about using ML to improve products and delight customers. You have experience developing streaming feature pipelines, building ML models, and deploying them to production, even if it involves making substantial changes to backend code. You are comfortable with ambiguity, love to take initiative, and have a bias towards action.

Minimum Requirements


 * Have at least 3 years of experience shipping ML systems in production
 * Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production systems

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $173,100 - $259,700. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

"Applied ML Engineer, Speech","San Francisco, CA","2024-05-16","Speak","About Us

Our mission is to become the de facto way people learn foreign languages. We begin by teaching the next billion people English and Spanish.

English is the global language of business, culture, and communication, and over 1.5 billion people around the world are actively trying to learn right now. Others dream of communicating with the half-billion native Spanish speakers across the globe. The problem is that it's nearly impossible to learn to speak a language without constant access to a speaking partner. Grammar and vocab apps don't really help – you need to actually converse with someone.

Speak is on a journey to fix this. We're creating an AI-powered experience that replicates the flow of a conversation, without needing a human on the other end. The goal is to make it radically more accessible to be able to have conversations in a foreign language and eventually help hundreds of millions of people gain fluency who otherwise wouldn't be able to.

We started on this journey over five years ago and we've still got a long ways to go. We're thoughtfully adding new team members only when we think they can truly play a big role in our mission.

Speak launched first in South Korea where we have quickly grown to become the top grossing education app in the country. We have now delivered this winning product to more than 30 countries globally and are continuing to expand to more markets in the coming months. The company is well funded, raising a recent Series B backed by investors like OpenAI, Founders Fund, Y Combinator, Khosla Ventures, Lachy Groom, Josh Buckley, and others. We’re a team of 60 based primarily in SF, Seoul, Tokyo, and Ljubljana.

You will also work closely with Product teams to design innovative learning experiences and measure the efficacy of production models as they affect our end users. We are a small, dynamic team where you will likely also contribute as a developer and thought partner on broader team projects like ASR, assessment, content personalization, and much more. This is an incredibly exciting time to join an ML team designing a personalized learning experience that will revolutionize language learning for millions of learners worldwide — come join us!

What You'll Be Doing


 * Training and deploying phoneme recognition models end-to-end, including monitoring, performance tracking, and retraining
 * Expanding our Pronunciation Coach to provide precise feedback and integrate more broadly across our learning platform
 * Tracking metrics to measure performance of existing phoneme models across markets
 * Building out an assessment system to provide nuanced feedback on pronunciation, intonation, prosody, and more
 * Building and maintaining data infrastructure; i.e. audio data pipelines, training/evaluation datasets creation and management, labeling/active learning loop
 * Supporting the broader Speech & ML team (e.g. developing and localizing ASR models)
   
   

What We're Looking For


 * Extensive experience training and deploying custom deep learning models to production (experience with audio/speech strongly preferred)
 * Proficiency in Python and common Deep Learning frameworks like PyTorch
 * Strong communication skills and the ability to explain complex ML concepts to non-technical stakeholders
 * Sharp product sense and an ability to think broadly and cross-functionally about model quality in the context of user experience

Why work at Speak


 * Join a fantastic, tight-knit team at the right time: we're growing very quickly, we've raised our Series B and an additional extension from some of the top investors in the valley, and we've achieved product-market fit in our initial markets. You'd join at a magical time when a single person could significantly change the course of the company.
 * Do your life's work with people you’ll love working with: we care strongly about our craft and want every person at Speak to feel like they're growing every day. We believe in the idea that working with people you both enjoy and have respect for makes everything better. We hire thoughtfully and only work with people we admire deeply.
 * Global in nature: We're live in over 40 countries and launching in a number of new markets soon. We have dedicated offices in San Francisco, Ljubljana, Seoul, and Tokyo, and you’ll have the opportunity to talk to users in each of these regions on a regular basis as well as travel.
 * Impact people's lives in a major way: Learning a language is one of the single most life-changing skills one can learn, and right now 99% of people never achieve their goal because the process is broken. We’re helping millions of people achieve their goals and improve their lives.

"Software Engineer, AI","United States","2024-04-18","The Browser Company","Hi, we're The Browser Company 👋 and we're building a better way to use the internet.

Browsers are unique in that they are one of the only pieces of software that you share with your parents as well as your kids. Which makes sense, they're our doorway to the most important things — through them we socialize with loved ones, work on our passion projects, and explore our curiosities. But on their own, they don’t actually do a whole lot, they’re kind of just there. They don’t help us organize our messy lives or make it easier to compose our ideas. We believe that the browser could do so much more — it can empower and support the amazing things we do on the internet. That’s why we’re building one: a browser that can help us grow, create, and stay curious.

To accomplish this lofty task, we’re building a diverse team of people from different backgrounds and experiences. This isn’t optional, it’s crucial to our mission, as we need a wide range of perspectives to challenge our assumptions and shape our browser through a bold, creative lens.

With that in mind, we especially encourage women, people of color, and others from historically marginalized groups to apply.

About The Role

Browsers know everything about us and what we do everyday, and yet they can’t predict our next move, morph themselves to better suit our tasks, or proactively take work off our plate. As the first AI Engineer at The Browser Company, you will work with product engineers to prototype and explore how we can build a smarter, more personalized web browser with a focus on privacy-preserving, on-device models.

You’ll work to answers questions like –


 * What kind of features are better suited for on-device models vs modern LLM APIs like GPT?
 * How can we get on-device inference quality to match that of GPT 3.5 or 4?
 * How can we get local LLM and embedding models to run faster and more performantly on our members’ machines?
 * Can we distill larger models into a smaller footprint? Or fine-tune local models to work well for our particular use-cases?
 * Can we fine-tune performant neural networks to do narrow tasks where the generalizability of LLMs are not necessary?
 * How do we collect or build synthetic datasets for our models in a privacy-safe way so we can continue to be one of the most privacy-sensitive browsers on the market
   
   

Overall you will...


 * Scope and spearhead projects to fine-tune, distill, or train models for various features within Arc
 * Push the boundaries of what on-device and privacy-safe AI and ML can be used for
 * Work with Product Engineers, Product Designers, and Design Engineers to understand how we can use heuristics, neural networks, and LLMs to create magical experiences within Arc
 * Build infrastructure to collect or generate training data for building or improving models
 * Build ways for us to determine and track model performance and accuracy, and improve performance and accuracy over time
   
   

After 1 month you will...


 * Onboard to the team and codebase with your onboarding buddy
 * Attend a number of onboarding presentations on the company, product, codebase, and culture
 * Get familiar with the Swift language, the Arc codebase, and how we ship features
 * Discuss and start formulating our ML roadmap with our CTO
 * Ship a few bug fixes and small improvements across our codebase and tooling
 * Have pair programmed with a few people on the engineering team
 * Be regularly posting product feedback about the browser in our #dogfooding channel
   
   

After 3 months you will...


 * Be familiar with how we prototype and build new features, working with product engineers to brainstorm ways to use models to add intelligence to Arc
 * Be familiar with our infrastructure and data pipelines
 * Ship a few prototypes with existing, on-device models to test performance and viability
 * Participate in product brainstorms to think about the future of Arc
 * Regularly attend weekly engineering discussions about our architecture, how we do code review, code style, and more
   
   

After 6 months you will...


 * Creatively solve problems with product engineers, using pragmatic solutions ranging from basic heuristics, regressions, ML models, to AI depending on the feature
 * Drive projects from conception to production launch independently
 * Own our infrastructure to collect training data and fine-tune models for our use-cases
 * Have built out mechanisms to assess quality and performance, and be working with product teams to improve the efficacy of our models and heuristics
 * Be interview trained and interviewing candidates for roles at the Browser Company
 * Be mentoring and pair-programming with newer engineers to help them get spun up on the codebase
   
   

Qualifications


 * You have experience developing and productionizing modern machine learning models, especially ones that can run under tight power and performance constraints, in a real-world product environment
 * You have experience with fine-tuning, distilling, and improving existing ML models
 * You're passionate about prototyping product features and using pragmatic solutions to solve problems, biasing for fast feedback loops
 * You’re experienced with Python and modern ML libraries
 * You have experience as a technical lead on critical projects or initiatives within your team and organization
 * You're pragmatic and can see the bigger picture. You're able to reason about prioritization and scope
 * You have a bias for action. We like learning as quickly as possible, so we embrace failing fast to refine our code, systems, and processes rapidly

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

"Machine Perception Engineer","Los Angeles, CA","2023-06-27","Universe Energy","We are Universe Energy, and we are the battery dismantling and repurposing company.

Our mission is to scale battery reuse as the largest source of the next billion batteries. The world needs 2 billion batteries by 2050, but this comes at a huge cost to the planet, as we need to mine 30x more. We dismantle and sort used battery packs 7x faster and 50% cheaper than by hand using robotics, AI and sound for EV OEMs, battery makers and fleets. Once we dismantle 1000s of battery packs, we repurpose them into $4000 cheap grid batteries that are 20% cheaper than making new ones. Our vision is to become the leading maker of zero-impact batteries by building 1 million batteries/year by 2035. This will power a truly clean energy revolution at scale and reduce 6 Giga tons of CO2 by 2050. We are Universe Energy, and we make batteries eternal.

The Bonobo Robot dismantles batteries.



We are building a cognitive robot that we call Bonobo that automatically diagnose, discharge, and disassemble EV batteries using robotic manipulation, autonomous controls, and computer vision. The first-generation robotic system will automatically assess the battery's state of health, remove covers from arbitrary battery packs (500 kg), and perform safe discharging. It then disassembles these batteries from the pack level (500 kg) down to the module level (25 kg). Bonobo can take batteries apart 4x faster and safer than a human at 6x the throughput, leading to 50% lower unit economics.

Job objective

You will conceptualize, architect, engineer, and deploy algorithms that allow the robot to see and recognize the configuration of EV battery packs. The perception system then tells the robot what it sees and identifies parts like connectors, welding seams, and modules. You will scan the battery packs and cells to decide on their health by analyzing images from battery cell material. Then it instructs the Bonobo robot how to take these apart. You will then validate the software with what the cameras and sensors on the Bonobo preceive.

Our Story

Our founders, Spence and John met at Google working on Google Translate. As researchers at Stanford and Berkeley, they both worked on language technology to make information accessible to everyone. They were amazed to learn that Google Translate wasn’t used for enterprise products and services inside the company and left to start a new company to address this need – Lilt.

At its core, Lilt has always been a machine learning company since its incorporation on March 6, 2015. At the time, machine translation didn’t meet the quality standard for enterprise translations, so Lilt assembled a cutting-edge research team tasked with closing that gap. While meeting customer demand for translation services, Lilt has prioritized investments in Large Language Models, believing that this foundation was imperative to the future of enterprise translation.
